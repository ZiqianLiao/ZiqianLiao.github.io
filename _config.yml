  Hey, Iâ€™m Ziqian. Welcome to my GitHub data science portfolio!
  In this portfolio, you will find a collection of my work in data science, including projects I have completed as part of my academic and professional training, as well as personal projects that demonstrate my skills and interests.

  I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and learn more about data science. 
  Thank you for visiting my portfolio and I hope you enjoy exploring my work.
